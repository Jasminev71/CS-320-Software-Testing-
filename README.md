# CS-320-Software-Testing-
**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
To ensure that my application and code are functional and secure, I wrote clear, modular code that validates each method using unit testing. JUnit testing helped to verify that
input, output, and exception handling are behaving as expected. As for security, I tried to follow best practices such as input validations, proper data
handling, and error checking to help prevent vulnerabilities like injection attacks or data corruption. 
**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
Understanding what a user may need is the start of breaking down what requirements are needed in software features. For this project, I translated user needs into software
features such as unique contact IDs, character limits, and data validation. Then I used test-driven development to help confirm that each feature met the intended behavior before moving to the next requirement
**How do I approach designing software?**
I used an iterative process that included planning, implementation, and testing. Each module is developed with maintainability and scalability in mind. I also tried to prioritize clarity in class structure and logic flow so that devs or QA engineers can easily understand and extend the code.
